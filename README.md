# beautjson

A kinda crappy but small minified JSON to tab-indented JSON. Programmed because
nothing I really tried could handle 200MB of minified JSON to beautify because
it crashed a lot of things and I needed to read it as a human first.

I love technology

## Usage

Outputs to `./result.json`

`go run main.go [input file]`
